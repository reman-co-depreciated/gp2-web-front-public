# Reman Web Front Internal

```
The primary directive of this item, the reman web front internal site, is to educate potential and existing reman clients about the value we create here.
As well as facilitate the exchange of that value for the value they can provide, often in the form of US currency.

This directive will be executed in the most simple and aesthetically pleasing way, with the lowest entropic exposure.
